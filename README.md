# Camper-App

Camper-App is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. 
This project was inspired by Colt Steele's web dev course.

This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

## Features
* Users can create, edit, and remove campgrounds
* Users can review campgrounds once, and edit or remove their review.
